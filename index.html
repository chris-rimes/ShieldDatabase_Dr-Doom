            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Early Years</h3>
            <p>
              While attending classes at the State university in Hegeman, New
              York, he met Reed Richards and Ben Grimm for the First Time.
              <br />They developed a dislike for each other. Richards and
              Doom were intellectual peers. While Richards designed his
              starship, Doom became obsessed with developing a machine that
              could project the astral form of a being into other dimensions,
              seeing it as a way to free his mother's soul from Mephisto's
              clutches. <br />Reed pointed out a flaw in Doom's
              calculations, but Doom arrogantly ignored his warnings. The machine exploded, scarring Doom's face. He was
              soon expelled for conducting unethical experiments. From then on,
              he blamed Reed Richards for the destruction of his face as well as
              his expulsion.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Becoming Doom</h3>
            <p>
              Disgraced and bitter, Doom traveled the world. Eventually he came
              upon a small Tibetan village of monks who assisted him in creating
              a suit of armor. He returned to his homeland of Latveria to
              overthrow the leader and declare himself king. <br />
              He then began to use his country's resources in order to further
              his plans of world domination. These schemes led Doom into
              conflict with the Fantastic Four on many occasions, as well as
              many other super heroes.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Freeing His Mother</h3>
            <p>
              Doom eventually freed his mother's soul with the assistance of
              Doctor Strange.<br />
              Strange had won the Aged Genghis' contest and was obligated to
              answer the request of the runner-up. The scheme to free his mother
              required Doom to incur her undying hatred; by volunteering Strange
              to take her place, Cynthia von Doom was so disgusted at her son
              that she became too pure to remain in Hell and departed for
              Heaven.<br />
              Strange wondered if Doom had been aware of this outcome when he
              made the deal, but Doom simply mused that his mother's hatred was
              a price he was willing to pay to ensure her freedom.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Hell & Back</h3>
            <p>
              Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment,
              simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap
              Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure
              Doom never threatens anyone again. <br /><br />

              However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to
              rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue,
              Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend
              to stop his greatest enemy. Doom is returned to Hell, but Reed is
              later able to use the same machine Doom once tried to create to
              travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life.

              When Mjolnir fell to Earth, it passed through
              time and space, momentarily breaching the gateway to Hell and
              providing Doom with an escape route.
              Doom regained control of Latveria, used its military to locate
              Mjolnir, and attempted to seize its power for himself. However, he soon discovered that he was not worthy.

            <p>
              During the super hero Civil War, Reed Richards and several other
              heroes defeated a Doombot in New York City. Doom himself may or
              may not have been responsible.<br />

              In another ploy to gain leverage during this time of disunity,
              Doom proposed an alliance between Latveria and the Black Panther's
              country of Wakanda. Black Panther and his new wife, Storm,
              however, saw through Doom's intrigue.

              Afterwards Doom sought to align his country with another.
              <br />
              Following the destruction of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis,
              Doctor Doom made Latveria into a refugee camp for the Atlanteans
              and struck an alliance with Loki in his plot to manipulate Thor to
              unwittingly release his Asgardian enemies.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Doctor Doom Arrested!</h3>
            <p>
              Iron Man led S.H.I.E.L.D. forces and the Mighty Avengers to
              Latveria when it was discovered that one of Doctor Doom's
              satellites carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City.
              <br />

              Using time travel, Doctor Doom had been involved in a romantic
              relationship with Morgan Le Fay at the time in exchange for her
              tutelage in the mystic arts. This arrangement was interrupted when
              the Mighty Avengers arrested Doctor Doom and incarcerated him for
              crimes against humanity. During the battle, Doctor Doom, Iron Man,
              and the Sentry stumbled through an open time travel portal,
              trapping Doctor Doom and his opponents in the past. Doctor Doom
              and Iron Man managed to return all three to the present

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Fantastic Force</h3>
            <p>
              Doctor Doom was released from prison by the Fantastic Force, a
              group from a distant future returned to the present. <br />
              The Fantastic Force kidnapped Doom and the Human Torch to use them
              as a power source for a time travel device that was made from the
              dead body of Galactus. The whole plan of the Fantastic Force was
              led by the future Sue Storm. In the end, Reed Richards and Sue
              Storm not only found a home for the future refugees, but also
              freed Doctor Doom and the Human Torch. <br />
              In what should have been a happy ending, Doctor Doom killed the
              future Sue Storm, to "restore his honor.

            <p>
              In the aftermath of the Skrull Invasion, Doctor Doom became a
              member of the Dark Cabal. After Doom refused Dracula's bargain.
              Morgan le Fay traveled to present day Latveria to punish Doctor
              Doom for failing to come through on his end of their bargain.
              <br />
              The Dark Avengers went to Doctor Doom's aid after Morgan le Fay
              defeated him in mystical combat. Norman Osborn rescued Doom from
              mystical paralysis, and they linked their armours to access Doom's
              time cube in order to go back in time and stop Morgan le Fay. Doom
              either could not or would not destroy le Fay, despite having the
              power to do so, because her future was intertwined with his.
              Instead, Doom sent her back in time, forcing her to battle her way
              back to her presen.

            <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i> Marquis of Death</h3>
            <p>
              After his initial capture and release for crimes against humanity,
              Doom revealed that he had been taught everything by a master,
              someone that was far more powerful and evil than he himself, and
              that he would soon be returning. <br /><br />
              When his master, the Marquis of
              Death, arrived, he was displeased with what Doom had been doing in
              the two decades since his departure. He expected Doom to be the
              vicious ruler of the Earth, not the ruler of a small country
              constantly defeated by heroes such as the Fantastic Four. After
              playing with his mind, he beat Doom and banished him to the
              Pliocene Age to die. <br /><br />
              With his new apprentice, the Marquis of Death
              began to torment the Fantastic Four as punishment, but was
              defeated by them. When Richards chose not to finish off his
              defeated foe, the Marquis' Apprentice, revealed to be Doom, did it
              for him. Dr. Doom waited for years in the past using all his
              knowledge and sorcery to survive. He then became the Marquis'
              Apprentice once more and waited for the moment that the Marquis
              would be weakened enough for him to gain his revenge, and it came
              when he faced Mr. Fantastic. Doom declared that all rivalries
              between him and Richards had long been settled to his
              satisfaction.

            <p>
              When Doom learned of a xenophobic group of Wakandans known as the Desturi, he began his plans for gaining access to the vast amounts of vibranium located in Wakanda. Vibranium has the ability to be magically charged and has infinite power potential, something Doom had figured how to use to make himself virtually unstoppable.<br /><br />
              Doom developed nanite cameras which were dispersed into all Wakandans, making them unknowing spies for Doom. With all the security information of Wakanda available to him, he was able to gain access to the vault that contained the country's vibranium. In a last ditch effort to stop him, T'Challa rendered all Wakandan vibranium inert and useless.
